# Classic-Arcade-Game
This game is based on the classic arcade games used to be which lead to its name **"Classic Arcade Game"**. The whole game is a Udacity Nanodegree Final Project. The entire resources were provided by the Udacity Team, stuffs like the characters, the game board , the measurement and **the game engine**. I have utilized the complete resources and made the logic of the entire game using simple to read comments in addition to the provided instructions in the comments.

##Installation
Just clone the GitHub repo and you are done open _index_ file and start playing.
`git clone https://github.com/MayurChandpara/Classic-Arcade-Game.git`

##The Rules:
1.Use left, up, down, right Arrows to navigate the character.

3.Reach the river to dive and win the Game.
4.Do not collide with the sprints that will send you back to start.

##Usages:
This game can be played by any age group excluding infants and a year children. Just Start OR Press the Start Button to go on gaming.
The Arrow keys are the playing keys so use them to navigate your character.

##Features:
-The game have five changeable characters to choose from.
-The game uses the new ES6 & the Old ES5  both the class declarations.
-The game is divided into 3 different pages Start.html, index.html and win.html. This can be changed to modals.
-The game have to use the query parsing while changing the pages to send the information over to the next page like the gems collected and the characters.
-If we use the modals then the scripting will be inti one single file and no query parsing will require in the app.
-The game is based on 3 objects and which points to the 3 dots of the game the Player, the enemy and the Gem.
-The gem is programed to appear randomly on the board except underground and the river portion. And it update's it's place for every 6 secs or if the player collects (which ever is early).
-The game uses the canvas at the heart of all the processes.
-So the elements need to be loaded in to the game to use it in the game, and that is taken care under the resources files(the loading, caching and rendering).
-The game uses the Delta time (dt) for the animation of the spirits. Due to which the game behaves in almost the same way on different devices.

##Conclusion
The game is built upon classes, objects and methods, it is a Object Oriented Program. Think before you edit any files. Specially the resources and the engine files.
If including new extra features remember to mention that in the engine file and also to render. And before using and images make sure you pass that through the resources file and load the images there.
